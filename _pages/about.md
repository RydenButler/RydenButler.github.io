I am a recent graduate of Washington University in St. Louis with a Ph.D. in Political Science and a Master's in Statistics. My concentrations of study are in Statistical Methodology and American Politics. My research analyzes political communications on social media, and focuses on how politicians use these tools to influence and engage with their constituents. In doing this research, I also adopt (and adapt) novel statistical techniques to quantify and analyze social media data.
