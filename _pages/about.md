I'm a social scientist who applies observational and experimental causal inference methods towards understanding the deeper "why" behind data scientific research questions. My recent work focuses on isolating causal estimates in dynamic two-sided marketplaces.

In 2021, I received a PhD in Political Science from Washington University in St. Louis, with concentrations in statistical methods and American politics. My graduate research analyzed political communication on social media, and focused on understanding how politicians use these tools to influence and engage with their constituents.
