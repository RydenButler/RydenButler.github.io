I am a political science PhD candidate at Washington University in St. Louis. My research analyzes political communications on social media, and focuses on how politicians use these tools to influence and engage with their constituents. In doing this research, I also adopt (and adapt) novel statistical techniques to quantify and analyze social media data.
